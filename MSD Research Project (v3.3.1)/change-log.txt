2.1.0:
(9-18-2014) Major "bug" fix in how random unit vectors are generated. Program output has changed noticeably. Demands recalculation of preliminary results.

2.1.1:
(9-18-2014) Minor UI changes in user programs. Metropolis now writes XML to file prior to its first thread completion. User programs now output MSD's version number for record keeping.

2.1.2:
(10-6-2014) Changed magnetize program to start at B_y_max decreasing to B_y_min before increasing back to B_y_max; this is the opposite of how it moved before. This is so the the initial state of 'all up' matches positive B_y saturation.

2.1.3:
(10-7-2014) Changed magnetize programs to output average magnetizations and energies along with final ones (like heat program already did.) Updated MSD_GUI's magnetize panel to pass "noop" instead of "reinitialize".

2.2.0:
(12-4-2014) Bug fix in MSD.h on line 578.
Biquadratic coupling algorithm corrected

3.0.0:
(12-4-2014) Added our first attempt at spin fluctuation code. This included a major overhaul of the code.

3.1.0:
(1-23-2015) Changed anisotropy to a vector, effecting energy calculations: -A_x * sum(m_x^2) - A_y * sum(m_y^2) - A_z * sum(m_z^2).
Added the ability to initialize the magnitude of each sections' atoms' spins: s_L, s_m, s_R.
Split spin flux F variable into three variables: FL, FR, Fm.

3.2.0:
(2-4-2015) Fix major bug in energy calculation in MSD::setLocalM. mL, LR and mR, LR sections under "if(x < molPosL)" and "if(x > molPosR)" section were written incorrectly as JL and JR respectively.

3.3.0:
(2-6-2015) Added new "magnetization2" program, which is given an initial t_eq, then a B_y_rate to slowly, continuously increase or decrease the magnetic field over time.
Optimize change in magnetic field energy calculations! Useful for the new magnetization2 program.
Also changed curie temperature approximation to be J * s^2.

3.3.1:
(2-13-2015) Added new program, "mfm_aggregator" (Magnetic Force Microscope Aggregator). This program takes copied Excel data from the "iterate" program and splits out formatted data for Excel to plot as 3D graphs.

TODO:
Add ability to "turn off" a percentage of the molecules by setting their spin = 0
