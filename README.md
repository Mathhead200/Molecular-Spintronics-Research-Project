	with much help and guidance from Prof. Pawan Tyagi

Version 5.1.1 is the current version as of 11-3-2020

v6.0.0 is a purposed change to the model to switch from an array structure to a linked structure for more flexibility, as well as adding an enhanched UI/GUI.
Currently these changes are not being worked on.

v5.*.* is the current development version. Planned additions:
	1. (Done.) Create support for input file for iterate.exe that allows for control of exact initial spin values for particular atoms.
	2. Create auxiluary program to compute auto-corralation between FM and mol., heat capacity of a sub-region of the model, and magnetic suseptibility of specicif regions of model.
	3. (Done?) Add toggle to change mol. so it can go from having 4 edges (square shaped), to only 2 edges (paralell lines shaped).
	4. Add skyrmion effect by adding new energy term
	5. Add FM layers

(11-1-2020) Version 5.1.0 is now complete and ready to be beta tested.
(11-3-2020) Version 5.1.1 has a major bug fix in calculations!
