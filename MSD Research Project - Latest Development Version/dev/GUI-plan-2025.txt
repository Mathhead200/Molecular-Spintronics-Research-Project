Mising Features:
* Add post-processing graphs
	** Magnetization over time, Energy over time, autocorrelation(?)
	** Ability to save gaphs
* Add more lenses (i.e., "View Types"): e.g., energy, spin vs. flux.
* Abilty to run multiple simulations simultaniously. (Ensemble or Experiment)
	** Create (left) side pane to house all open simulations.
	** Selecting an open simulation from the side pane should update parameters, 3D, and timeline.
	** Create ability to add post-processing graph that look at the full list of open simulations.

UI/UX fixes:
* Input fields should auto-highlight on focus so they can be easily modifed.
* Save pane size and camera position on refreash.

* File name for "Download CSV" output is wrong.
* We noticed a problem with the view methods currently being used and the output data.
	Try to reproduce and fix this issue.
* Change UI for show/hide parameters & timeline.
* Custom colors for regions and match them with parameters pane.
