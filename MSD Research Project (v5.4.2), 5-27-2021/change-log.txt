2.1.0:
(9-18-2014) Major "bug" fix in how random unit vectors are generated. Program output has changed noticeably. Demands recalculation of preliminary results.

2.1.1:
(9-18-2014) Minor UI changes in user programs. Metropolis now writes XML to file prior to its first thread completion. User programs now output MSD's version number for record keeping.

2.1.2:
(10-6-2014) Changed magnetize program to start at B_y_max decreasing to B_y_min before increasing back to B_y_max; this is the opposite of how it moved before. This is so the the initial state of 'all up' matches positive B_y saturation.

2.1.3:
(10-7-2014) Changed magnetize programs to output average magnetizations and energies along with final ones (like heat program already did.) Updated MSD_GUI's magnetize panel to pass "noop" instead of "reinitialize".

2.2.0:
(12-4-2014) Bug fix in MSD.h on line 578.
Biquadratic coupling algorithm corrected

3.0.0:
(12-4-2014) Added our first attempt at spin fluctuation code. This included a major overhaul of the code.

3.1.0:
(1-23-2015) Changed anisotropy to a vector, effecting energy calculations: -A_x * sum(m_x^2) - A_y * sum(m_y^2) - A_z * sum(m_z^2).
Added the ability to initialize the magnitude of each sections' atoms' spins: s_L, s_m, s_R.
Split spin flux F variable into three variables: FL, FR, Fm.

3.2.0:
(2-4-2015) Fix major bug in energy calculation in MSD::setLocalM. mL, LR and mR, LR sections under "if(x < molPosL)" and "if(x > molPosR)" section were written incorrectly as JL and JR respectively.

3.3.0:
(2-6-2015) Added new "magnetization2" program, which is given an initial t_eq, then a B_y_rate to slowly, continuously increase or decrease the magnetic field over time.
Optimize change in magnetic field energy calculations! Useful for the new magnetization2 program.
Also changed curie temperature approximation to be J * s^2.

3.3.1:
(2-13-2015) Added new program, "mfm_aggregator" (Magnetic Force Microscope Aggregator). This program takes copied Excel data from the "iterate" program and splits out formatted data for Excel to plot as 3D graphs.

5.0.0:
(2-24-2020) Added four new parameters: topL, bottomL, frontR, backR. This allows us to change the geometry of the device to a cross shape.

5.1.0:
(11-1-2020) Added ability to change the magnitude of specific atoms.
This allows us to turn off some atoms, to turn off 2 "edges" of the molecule, and to potentially make certian molecule sites stronger.

5.1.1:
(11-3-2020) Fixed major bug where MSD::metropolis() was calling the wrong pow() function!
Also added fix for T_c approximation in MSD::setParameters().

5.2.0:
(11-17-2020) Added the ability to set a custom seed in the MSD model, and incorperated this functionality into the iterate program.

5.3.0:
(12-15-2020) Changed the spin fluxtuation algorithm so that now spin fluxtuations are a uniformaly random vector with a random magnitude betwwen [0, F).

5.3.1:
(12-15-2020) Updated the magnetization and magnetization2 programs to allow for a change of B along any axis, not just in the y direction.

5.3.2:
(2-5-2021) Bug fix in MSD::setParameters(). Was accidentally normalizing the flux vectors, when instead they should just be scaled by p.FL / p0.FL.
Also added a build_all.bat file which compiles all the .cpp program files using "cl".
Second bug fix. In MSD::setParameters()
        MSD.h:628    if( y + 1 < bottomL ) {
       changed to    if( y + 1 <= bottomL ) {
  also, MSD.h:660    if( z + 1 < backR ) {
       changed to    if( z + 1 <= backR ) {

5.4.0:
(1-21-2021) Added Parameters Je0, Je1, Jee (including L, R, mL, mR, m, LR variations where applicable)
	Added new exchange coupling parameters to connect each electron to (Je0) its local atom, (Je1) its nearest neighbor atoms, and (Jee) its nearest neighbor electrons.
	Changed Heisenburg exchange coupling constant J so only bond the spin, s, and NOT the local magnetization, m = s + f.
(2-10-2021) Add support for new J variables in all applicable programs: iterate, heat, magnetize(2), metropolis.
	kT_inc < 0 now cools in "heat" program.
	Added B_norm to output of "magnetize" and "magnetize2".
	Added a check for kT_inc == 0, B_inc == 0, or B_rate == 0 to avoid an infinite loop (in their respective programs).
(3-2-2021) Added new parameters to MSD::Parameters::operator==
(3-9-2021) Added missing "throw" keyword on MSD.h:379, MSD::Iterator::operator++()

5.4.1:
(3-23-2021) Major bug fixes in MSD.h. The Je1 energy term was not being calculated correctly in MSD::setParameters().
	Fixes a bug in MSD::Iterator::operator++ / += where an exception was thrown when trying to iterate to MSD::end().
	Added build_tests.bat file and bin/tests directory for tests.
	Uncommented out the Je0, Je1, and Jee tests in test-setLocalM.
	Added RADNOMIZE and REINITIALIZE options for metropolis program.

5.4.2:
(5-25-2021) Added "Label" support to parameters-metropolis.txt input file.
	Added custom spin support to parameters-metropolis.txt input file.
	Added snapshot of final configuration (as XML) after each simualtion.
	Slight optimization in energy calculation: factored out Je1.
(5-27-2021) Added build_metropolis.bat to only build metropolis program (saves time)
