2.1.0:
(9-18-2014) Major "bug" fix in how random unit vectors are generated. Program output has changed noticeably. Demands recalculation of preliminary results.

2.1.1:
(9-18-2014) Minor UI changes in user programs. Metropolis now writes XML to file prior to its first thread completion. User programs now output MSD's version number for record keeping.

2.1.2:
(10-6-2014) Changed magnetize program to start at B_y_max decreasing to B_y_min before increasing back to B_y_max; this is the opposite of how it moved before. This is so the the initial state of 'all up' matches positive B_y saturation.

2.1.3:
(10-7-2014) Changed magnetize programs to output average magnetizations and energies along with final ones (like heat program already did.) Updated MSD_GUI's magnetize panel to pass "noop" instead of "reinitialize".
