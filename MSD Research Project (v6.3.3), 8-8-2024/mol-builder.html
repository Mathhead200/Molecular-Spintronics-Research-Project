		<h1> Instructions </h1>
		<p>
			<u>Create Node</u>:
			Click on a blank space in the canvas (above) to create a new node.
			<br><br>

			<u>Create Edge</u>:
			Drag from source node to destination node to create a edge between them.
			(For non-communative effects like Dm where direction matters,
			the direction of the edge is from source to destination.)
			<br><br>
			
			<u>Modify Node or Edge Parameters</u>:
			Select a node or edge by clicking on it. The current parameters will be displayed aside
			(or below) the canvas in the "form" section. These parameters can be modified
			by editing the fields in the form. The new values will be immediately saved and applied.
			<br><br>
			
			<u>Delete Node</u>:
			Drag node to the red "X", then drop.
			<br><br>
			
			<u>Delete Edge</u>:
			Ctrl-click on an edge to delete it.
			Note: edges will automatically be deleted if one of their attached nodes is deleted.
			<br><br>
			
			<u>Move Node</u>:
			You can move the location of a node, by dragging it to an unoccupied location.
			Note: moving a node, will also move its edges appropriately.
			<br><br>

			<u>Save Molecule</u>:
			Pressing the save button (found above the canvas) saves the current molecule configuration
			to the browser's local storage. If you refreash, or close and reopen the mol-builder,
			the last saved configureation will be loaded automatically. Any previously saved molecule
			in local storage will be overwritten. (This does not include previously downloaded .mmt files.
			These will still be on your computer.)
			<br>
			&emsp;&emsp;Moreover, the MMT (MSD Molecule Text) area will appear aside
			(or below) the canvas in the "form" section. If the MMT area is modified, the molecule
			will change dynamically; <i>however</i>, these changes are <i>not</i> saved unless the save button to
			pressed again.
			<br><br>

			<u>Download Molecule</u>: You must first save the molecule.
			After saving, a dowload link will be displayed below the MMT area.
			Clicking the download line saved the current MMT text to a .mmt file
			on your computer. Once downloaded, this file is not affected by any changes to the MMT area.
			<br><br>

			<u>Clear Molecule</u>: Pressing the clear button will clear the molecule.
			The previously saved molecule will still be saved until overwritten.
